# Irving's GNU/Linux Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles! I push changes from my X200 running Parabola or my X220 running Arch. These files are distro-independent

## Programs whose configs can be found here

+ i3 (i3-gaps)
+ Xresourses info used by [my st build](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/st) as a terminal
+ vim
+ bash
+ ranger 
+ calcurse
+ ncmpcpp and mpd (my main music player)

+ neofetch
+ And many little scripts I use filed in the `~/.scripts/` directory

## More documentation

## Dynamic Configuration Files

Store your favorite or high-traffic directories in `~/.config/bmdirs` or your most
important config files in `~/.config/bmfiles` with keyboard shortcuts. When you add
things to theses files my vimrc will automatically run `shortcuts` which will
dynamically generate shortcuts for these in bash, ranger and optionally
qutebrowser and fish.

# "Dependencies" and programs used

The programs I use here are always changing, but luckily you can just look at the installation list for [LARBS](http://larbs.xyz) here:

+ [List of programs installed by LARBS, including optional packages](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS/blob/master/progs.csv)

`A` marks programs in the AUR, `G` marks git repositories.
